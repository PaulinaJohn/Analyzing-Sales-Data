# Introduction

I am usually very excited about this project because it was my first entry ever for a data analytics competition. I participated in the competeion on [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/a2ece60c-ed98-4602-8fdb-38e7ee8a1afe), courtesy of [Ingressive for Good](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ingressiveforgood/). I won the Ingressive for Good 1000womeninData Scholarship in 2021. Through this, was able to learn Data Anlytics, execute projects and participate in competitions on Datacamp.
