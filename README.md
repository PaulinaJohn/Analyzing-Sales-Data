# Introduction

Often, I have this smile on my face each time I stumble on this project because it was my first entry ever, for a data analytics competition. 

I participated in the competition on [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/a2ece60c-ed98-4602-8fdb-38e7ee8a1afe), courtesy of [Ingressive for Good](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ingressiveforgood/). 

I won the Ingressive for Good 1000womeninData Scholarship in 2021. Through this opportunity, I was privileged to learn Data Analytics, execute projects and participate in competitions on Datacamp. 

I believe that in the very near future, this seemingly superficial body of work :blush: would prove a nolstalgic reminder of my baby steps towards becoming a data professional.
